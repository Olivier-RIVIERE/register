# My Blog 📝

This project is a dynamic blog built with Symfony. It allows users to register, log in. Users can also log out via a dedicated button, and a personalized message is displayed based on the user's login status. The blog follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and includes user management features. 🚀

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in backend development with Symfony and user authentication management while creating a modern, responsive user interface. 💻🎨

## Features ✨

- **Registration and Login**: Users can register and log in. 🆔
- **User Authentication**: Displays a personalized message depending on whether the user is logged in or not. 👤
- **Logout**: Users can log out at any time. 🚪


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structure and content. 🏗️
- **CSS**: For styling the application. 🎨
- **Symfony**: PHP framework for the backend and route management. 🖥️
- **Twig**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic views. 🧩
- **Doctrine**: ORM for database management. 🗃️
